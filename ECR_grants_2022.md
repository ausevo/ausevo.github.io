# *Grant description*

The Australasian Evolution Society is committed to expanding and providing opportunities for young researchers in the field. This year we will offer support by providing ECR grants towards projects undertaken in the Australasian region. 
 
**Distribution of grants**
 
- Up to three grant winners (video format), each receiving up to $2500 (2500/2000/1000) + free registration at AES 2022

- Up to two additional ECR grants (poster format, $500 each) + free registration at AES 2022

- Two highly commended (free registration at AES 2022)
 
**What will we fund?**
 
The main aim of these grants is to promote collaborations among members in our Society or Australasia. There are no specific restrictions on how the funds can be used. They can cover flights and accommodation to visit collaborators, registration costs to attend conferences or workshops that can lead to networking, or they can be used for laboratory or field work in a project that involves members of different research groups. The only requisite is that the project should involve more than one research group in Australasia.
 
**Eligibility**
 
-       Applicants must be a member of AES (we consider members those that have attended one of the two last conferences). If not, membership can be paid          [here](https://aes.corsizio.com/c/623ce1d83b5782883219ce9a). 

-       Applicants must belong to an institution in the Australasian region.

-       Successful applicants will attend AES 2022.
 
**How to apply?**
 
The main application format is a short video (max 3 minutes) that explains the research being proposed and why your research question is interesting. The video should not contain information on budget, just the science and the research question being asked. If the funds are used to attend a workshop or to learn a technique, then the video should explain the research question that will employ those methods or techniques learned. **Three main grants ($2500/2000/1000) will be awarded to the best videos**. There are no guidelines on the format of the videos, and we do not expect applicants to have professional video editing skills. Surprise us!
 
If videos are not your thing, an optional application format will be in the form of a poster. The poster (like a conference poster, but pitching an idea) should not contain information on budget, just the research question (as explained above). If this format is selected the grant will be **$500 (x 2)**. 

Information on budget should be provided in text (~100 words, space in form). We reserve the right to re-distribute grants in proportion to the number of participants in each format. 
 
Please upload your video to vimeo/youtube or other service, and provide the link and other information (poster file) in [here](https://melbourneuni.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8dnXWwPjB9qjWPY). You can also choose to paste the link of a dropbox transfer. 
 
**Selection criteria**
 
Grants will be assessed by an external panel of experts, chaired by the president and vice-president of the Society. Applications will be judged on their creativity, the quality of the research proposed, and the likelihood that it will lead to a successful collaboration or successful networking.
