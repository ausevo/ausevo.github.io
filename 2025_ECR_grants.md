**Grant description**
 
The Australasian Evolution Society is committed to expanding and providing opportunities for young researchers in the field. This year we will offer support by providing ECR grants towards projects undertaken in the Australasian region. Two awards will be open (ECRs and PhD students) can apply and one award reserved only for PhD students.  

**Distribution of grants**

- First prize: $2500  
- Second prize: $2000  
- PhD only prize: $1500  


**What will we fund?**

The main aim of these grants is to promote collaborations among members in our Society or Australasia. There are no specific restrictions on how the funds can be used. Funds can be used to cover flights and accommodation to forge new collaborations or visit existing collaborators, or they can be used for laboratory or field work in a project that involves members of different research groups. The only requisite is that the project should involve more than one research group in Australasia.  

**Eligibility**

- For the purpose of this grant, we define Early Career Researcher (ECRs) as someone who is currently a PhD student or have completed their PhD within the last 5 years (received their PhD *after* 18 April 2020). The first and second prizes are open to all ECRs.

- Only current PhD students are eligible to win the PhD only prize.

- Applicants must be a member of AES (we consider members those that have attended one of the two last conferences). If not, membership can be paid [here](https://aes.corsizio.com/c/623ce1d83b5782883219ce9a). 

- Applicants must belong to an institution in the Australasian region.

**How to apply?**
 
Your application should be sent as a single PDF file to the AES Executive Committee. 

Submissions open now until the **18th April 2025**
