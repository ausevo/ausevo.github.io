These awards give the AES community the opportunity to hear some of the most exciting science done by our early career researchers. Applying is extremely easy, because youâ€™ve already done the hard work! All you need is to submit your best/favourite paper and provide a short statement of contribution and impact. Preprints can be submitted too.

A panel of judges will select the best publications and we will invite the main author (ECR who submitted) to give a 30-minute plenary at our AES conference in Brisbane. AES will cover registration (refunded if already paid) and provide $500 towards accommodation/travel.

There will be two categories, one for Post-doctoral research and one for PhD research.
