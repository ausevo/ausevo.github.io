These awards give the community the opportunity to hear some of the most exciting science done by our early career researchers. Applying is extremely easy, because you’ve already done the hard work. All you need to do is **submit your best/favourite paper** and provide a statement of contribution and impact. **Preprints can be submitted too**.  
 
We will select our favourite publications and invite the authors (ECR who submitted) to give a 30 minute plenary at our AES conference in Canberra. AES will cover registration (will refund if you already paid) and provide $250 towards accommodation. 
 
There will be two categories, one for post-doctoral researchers and one for grad students. 
 
Outcomes will be announced the first week of November. -->
