# 2024 ECR Research Awards nomination open

Apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHUw3oDZTsG0aelXWkxDLQKhJDNSe9znM9P3G_IQK1sDPWmA/viewform)
Deadline: 30 September 2024

These awards give the AES community the opportunity to hear some of the most exciting science done by our early career researchers. Applying is extremely easy, because you’ve already done the hard work! All you need is to submit your best/favourite paper and provide a short statement of contribution and impact. Preprints can be submitted too.

We will select our favourite publications and invite the main author (ECR who submitted) to give a 30 minute plenary at our AES conference in Perth. AES will cover registration (will refund if you already paid) and provide $500 towards accommodation/travel.

There will be two categories, one for Post-doctoral research and one for PhD research.

Outcomes will be announced the last week of October, so there is enough time for winners to prepare their awesome talks.
