We have worked hard to make the conference as affordable as possible in the hope that we will have as many of our students and ECR members attend.

Talk submission will follow. As in previous years, for talk presentations we do not request an abstract on application, only a title (that you can also update later).
<!-- We hope to run tag-team presentations again, as well as the usual standard and flash talk options.   -->

#### Registration fees 

All registration fees are in Australian dollars and are inclusive of GST. Early bird registration ends on the 1st of September. Final registration closes 29th of September 2025.

#### Presentations

When you register, please indicate whether you would like to present. These will be your options:  

- No talk, I am happy just listening to some really amazing talks  

- Flash talk (3 mins), I’ve got some super neat stuff to tell you and it won’t take me that long  

- Standard talk (10 mins + 3 mins for question), my research is so cool, you won’t be able to shut me up  

- Tag-team talk\* (45 mins including questions), not only am I awesome, my whole team is awesome and we all really want to tell you about what we’re doing  

\*Tag-team talks are talks given by several members of the same research group (4 - 5), talking about related research topics that can be told as a whole story. -->

<!-- #### Accomodation 

See this [page](/accommodation/) for details.

#### Equity and Inclusion

We are really keen to create an open and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels welcome. We understand that conferences are not equally accessible to everyone, and we are aiming to be as inclusive as possible.

With this in mind,

-	We are looking into options of making a **parent/child friendly** conference, if you would like to bring your children, please indicate this when you register.

-	We will be providing **travel grants** to those in need. If you would like to be considered for one of these travel grants please indicate this when you register. 

-	We will have **online options available** for those who cannot attend in person. 

If you feel that there is anything else we can do that would make you feel more comfortable attending AES2023, please get in touch, we are very open to suggestions.
