We have worked hard to make the conference as affordable as possible in the hope that we will have as many of our students and ECR members attend.

Talk submission will follow. As in previous years, for talk presentations we do not request an abstract on application, only a title (that you can also update later).
<!-- We hope to run tag-team presentations again, as well as the usual standard and flash talk options.   -->

#### Venue

Talks and events will be around the Great Court on UQ's St. Lucia campus. The conference dinner will be at [The Burrow](https://www.theburrowwestend.com.au/), 52 Russell St, West End QLD 4101.

#### Equity and Inclusion

We are really keen to create an open and friendly atmosphere where everyone feels welcome. We understand that conferences are not equally accessible to everyone, and we are aiming to be as inclusive as possible.

With this in mind,

- We are looking into options of making a **parent/child friendly** conference, if you would like to bring your children, please indicate this when you register.  

- We will have **online options available** for those who cannot attend in person.  

If you feel that there is anything else we can do that would make you feel more comfortable attending AES2025, please get in touch, we are very open to suggestions.

Any questions please send us an email: ausevolutionsociety@gmail.com
