# Getting to the 2024 AES Conference Venue

Welcome to Perth! We are excited to host you at the 2024 Australasian Evolution Society Conference. Below are detailed instructions to help you reach the conference venue at the Arts Complex (35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley WA 6009), The University of Western Australia (UWA), from Perth Airport.

## From Perth Airport to UWA

### By Taxi or Rideshare

- **Taxi**: Taxis are available from designated ranks at both the Domestic and International terminals. The journey to UWA takes approximately 25-35 minutes and costs around AUD 40-60, depending on traffic.  

- **Rideshare**: Services like Uber and Didi are also available. Follow the signs to the rideshare pickup points at the terminals. The fare is typically slightly lower than a taxi.  

### By Public Transport

If you wish to check up-to-date times of public transport services and plan your own journey, you can use the following link: https://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/Journey-Planner or download the Transperth app.  

1. **Bus**: 
   - From the airport, take Bus Route 37, 380 (operated by Transperth) from Terminals 1 and 2, or Bus Route 40 from Terminals 3 and 4, to Elizabeth Quay Bus Station.
   Transfer to Bus Route 950, heading towards UWA. Get off at the UWA bus stop on Stirling Highway. Note: There are many buses that go to UWA from the 950 stop at Elizabeth Quay, so if you miss the 950, one of the other buses will likely not be far away!  

 The total travel time is approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes, and the fare is around AUD 5.

2. **Train**:
   - Take the Airport Line train from Perth Airport Station to Perth Station.
   - Take Bus Route 950 from the bus stop opposite Perth Station, in front of Forrest Chase Shopping Centre, to UWA. The bus will make a brief stop at Elizabeth Quay Bus Station and then continue to UWA. This journey also takes around 1 hour and 15 minutes.

### By Car

- **Car Rental**: Several car rental services are available at the airport. The drive to UWA takes about 25-35 minutes via the Graham Farmer Freeway and Stirling Highway. Parking at UWA can be limited, so it’s advisable to check parking availability in advance. Please note that if you are planning to park a car at UWA, all campus carparks now use the EasyPark app for payment. Visitors will need to park in the yellow ‘Student and Visitor’ parking bays. Please download and install the EasyPark app on your mobile device before your arrival.
