# 2024 ECR Research Awards nomination open

Apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHUw3oDZTsG0aelXWkxDLQKhJDNSe9znM9P3G_IQK1sDPWmA/viewform)
Deadline: 30 September 2024

These awards give the AES community the opportunity to hear some of the most exciting science done by our early career researchers. Applying is extremely easy, because youâ€™ve already done the hard work! All you need is to submit your best/favourite paper and provide a short statement of contribution and impact. Preprints can be submitted too.

We will select our favourite publications and invite the main author (ECR who submitted) to give a 30 minute plenary at our AES conference in Perth. AES will cover registration (will refund if you already paid) and provide $500 towards accommodation/travel.

There will be two categories, one for Post-doctoral research and one for PhD research.

Outcomes will be announced the last week of October, so there is enough time for winners to prepare their awesome talks.
