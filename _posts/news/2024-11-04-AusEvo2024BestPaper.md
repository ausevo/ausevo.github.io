# Save the date for this year’s Australasian Evolution Society Conference!

We are excited to announce the winners of our ECR Best Paper Plenary Awards! There are two awards, one for post-doctoral research and one for PhD research, and each award winner will present a plenary at the upcoming conference on the research conducted in their respective papers. 

The winner of the **postdoctoral award is Dr Maddie James**, for the paper “Uncovering the genetic architecture of parallel evolution” (Molecular Ecology 2023), which used a novel approach to address the fundamental question of whether evolution is repeatable.

The winner of the **PhD award is Dr Sara Ryding**, for the paper “Long- and short-term responses to climate change in body and appendage size of diverse Australian birds” (Global Change Biology 2024), which provided a comprehensive investigation into morphological changes (“shape-shifting”) across environmental gradients in birds.


Congratulations to both Maddie and Sara on their outstanding research; we are thrilled to have them present plenaries at AES 2024!
